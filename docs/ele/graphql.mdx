### What is GraphQL

GraphQL is a structured query language developed by facebook for their massive relational user data.
Dealing with visualizing this relational data proved quite a challenge for the UI designers as with
classical models it was hard to get exactly the data needed. This is why they developed GraphQL:

Its easiest to understand as a contract between the person querying the data and the server that
will give exactly that data back, resolving the complex data queries on the databases. A complex
dataquery that would result in writing multiple custom SQL Queries boils then down to just
specifying what data you want in which structure.

On top of that GraphQL provides some unique features that make it a perfect fit for scientific data:

- (auto-generated) Schema and Documentation
- strongly typed
- code generation libraries for typescript and javascript
- allows real time updates

### Interaction

:::warning

This is by no means a complete introduction to GraphQL. As a standard in webdevelopment you will find a lot
of tutorials on how to get you started.

The Above example is a GraphQL Playground for easy Prototyping of your Queries. Take some time to
familiarize with the interface.
