## What is a Flow?

A flow is an organisational outline of your work. It illustrated through connections
of nodes how data *flows* in your workflow. 

### Example

Consider the following pretty basic Analysis Flow



Look at it for a second. It describes your Analysis of the Images as you might have a mental layout. Compare this

## What is a Node

A Node in this graph represents an analysis Task. 


## Task vs Implementation

One of the core initial misconceptions is the difference that arkitekt makes between Tasks and Implementations.
For the most part your 

| Task | Implementation |
| -----| -------------- |
| Maximum Intensity Projection | ImageJ's Maximum Intensity Projection (Macro) |
| Microscope | STED Microscope in Room A, PALM Microscope in Room B |
| Cell Segmentaiton | StarDist Segmentaiton algorythm |

The goal of this seperation is to create common Language to talk to these devices and use them interchangably in your workflow.

### What are the benefits

This seperation creates a common Language to talk to the devices 

> We of course acknowledge that due to "science" some of your analysis task will not adhere to some predefined
