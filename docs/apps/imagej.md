## MikroJ







### MikroJ is just ImageJ

MikroJ is Mikros flavour of ImageJ. It is a fully funcitonal fiji installation that is wrapped by little
python code to make it operational with the platform. By default it allows you to easily show and upload
images. MikroJ is however also able to take automation either further by using ImageJ macros and run them
as nodes on the platform. 



### Plugins / Macros

Some standard macros are built in but you can easily convert any macro code in imagej by just giving
the platform information of what input and outputs it needs.
